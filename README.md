# Robotic Operating Systems (ROS)
*(Information provided are obtained from the [Official Website](https://www.ros.org) of ROS)
### What is ROS?
"*The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source.*"
### [Why ROS ?](https://www.ros.org/blog/why-ros/)
### ROS 1 *vs* ROS 2
Before getting into the details of ROS, we have ROS 1 and ROS 2. Let's understand the differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2 (So that you will be able to make the right choice !) \
ROS1 was developed first and ROS2 was developed later with all the missing features in ROS1. ROS2 aims for the compatibility of Industrial Applications. The core concepts of both ROS1 and ROS2 are the same. \
*(**In the following Tutorial we're majorly focussed on ROS 1.**)*
## Installation
### Prerequisites :
### List of Active ROS 1 Distros :
(*You would require an Ubuntu Virtual Machine or a Dual Booted System to install ROS*)
* ROS [Melodic Morenia](https://wiki.ros.org/melodic) (Ubuntu 18.04 - Bionic and Ubuntu 17.10 - Artful) \
*()
* ROS [Noetic Ninjemys](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic) (Ubuntu 20.04 - Focal)
### List of Active ROS 2 Distros :
* ROS [Foxy Fitzroy](http://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/)
* ROS [Humble Hawksbill](http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)

*(Procedure for the installation of the above mentioned Distros are attached as HyperLink above)
### Possible Errors and Solution!

<!-- *Later on, ROS1 will be specified as ROS* -->
## Applications of ROS
Before we start learning about ROS, the following are a few of the applications of ROS,
* *First multi-purpose robot designed for use on the aerospace factory floor for aircraft sanding and coating removal using advanced sensors to conduct real-time path planning and analysis as it moves around the aircraft*
* *Robotic 3D printing on a non-planar surface using open-source tools for generating robot trajectories with a ROS-enabled robot*
* *Two inverted robots paint commercial aircraft skins using sensor fusion and open-source software tools for real-time robot trajectory planning on the fly.*
* *Autonomous mobile robot uses sensor fusion capabilities developed with ROS open-source software tools to freely and safely navigate the production aisleways of this automaker*
* *Autonomous robotic shuttle is equipped with a 3D printed arm and gripper destined for e-commerce robotic picking applications*
